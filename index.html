<h2>Hi, I'm Tim</h2>

<p>This site is out of date, however will be updated soon!</p>

<p>In the mean time, if you want to find out about me, here are some links...</p>

<p><a href="https://fov.ie/">Field of Vision</a>, this is our startup that I'm  working on with my long time friends, Omar and David:). We are buidling a touchbased device to help visually impaired people 'watch' live sport.<p>

<p>I ~am currently working~ worked on a research project with <a href="https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/team/stuart-armstrong/">Stuart Armstrong</a> who leads a lot of the work on AI Safety at the <a href="https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/">Future of Humanity Institute</a> in Oxford. We are basically trying to build a robust way to cluster deceptive behaviour in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Leraning environments. You can read Stuart's brief <a href="https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/xujLGRKFLKsPCTimd/p/oeCXS2ZCn4rPyq7LQ">here</a><p>

<p>I ~will also soon be working~ worked on my own project with <a href="https://www.scss.tcd.ie/Ivana.Dusparic/">Ivana Dusparic</a>, here in Trinity, trying to develop a sort of 'empathy mechanism' again in MARL environments... more details to come, this is something I'm really excited about! </p>

<p>Or here is my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/timfarrelly2000/">LinkedIn</a> if that's what you're into. I should also add that I can be contacted at farrelti[at]tcd[dot]ie<p>

<p>And here is a link to some of my favourite art: <a href="art/art.html">Art</a></p>

<p> Here are some good essays on writing, that tend towards personal websites/ blogs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Michael Nielsen, <a href="https://mnielsen.github.io/wn/website_enhance.html">'How to use a personal website to enhance your ability to think and create?'</a></li>
<li>Alexey Guzey, <a href="https://guzey.com/personal/why-have-a-blog/">'Why You Should Start a Blog Right Now'</a></li>
