<h2>Hi, I'm Tim</h2>

<p>I'm 22, currently on a gap year from studying Computer Engineering at Trinity College Dublin. Working on <a href="https://fov.ie/">Field of Vision</a>, with my two friends Omar and David. We are building handheld touchbased devices to help visually impaired sports fans 'watch' live sport. I build everything software and camera related</p>

<p>I have also worked on AI research:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Tried to build a sort of <em>Empathy Mechanism</em> for AI Agents using counterfactuals with Tom Franzemeyer (Oxford), Christian Schroeder de Witt (Oxford), and Ivana Dusparic (Trinity College Dublin)</li>
  <li>Tried to identify deception and betrayal in multi-agent reinforcement learning systems with Stuart Armstrong (Oxford)</li>
</ul>

<p>I can be contacted at farrelti[at]tcd[dot]ie<p>

<p>Here is a page with some of my <strong>favourite art</strong>: <a href="art/art.html">The Gallery</a></p>

<p>Here are some good essays on writing, that tend towards personal websites/ blogs:</p>
