  <p> For some brief content before I get things here sorted out, here's a very brief piece I wrote recently: <p> 
  
  <i> Most people love movies, I love movies. 
  <br>
  <br>
But it is commonly agreed that too much media consumption is unhealthy, especially for kids and teenagers. Zooming in on this further, I believe that one particular aspect of too much media consumption has the potential to be pernicious. Happy endings. 
<br>
<br>
Just about every single movie, especially kid and family movies, or ‘teen-flicks’, have happy endings. The good guys always trump the baddies. The family is always reunited with a long embrace. The prince always finds a way to kiss the princess and live happily ever after.
<br>
<br>
When was the last time you saw a movie, that had a ‘non-happy’** ending? I personally need to consult my movie log to remember.
<br>
<br>
** Note: ‘non-happy ending’ and ‘happy endings’ are not always mutually exclusive. Something can be beautiful and happy yet twinged with sadness or confusion. For now, we’ll assume ‘non-happy ending’ to include both.
<br>
<br>
Happy endings are fun! That warm feeling we get at a satisfying and content conclusion is great! Part of the function of cinema is to forget about the real world, and experience things and feelings from new perspectives that aren’t quite yours - that is a valuable thing. 
<br>
<br>
But it becomes problematic when every single box office movie needs to have a happy ending, especially those catering towards those under 18 years old. Why? Because life doesn’t always have a happy defined ending, and that’s ok... that’s life. 
<br>
<br>
With movies and stories, we have the perfect tool and opportunity to prepare kids for life and the beautiful mess that it can be sometimes. And I think a good way to do this would be with movies that are equally beautiful non-linear messes. I think society would be better off if we had more ‘non-happy ending’ stories and media within our lives and consumed less of the other stuff.
