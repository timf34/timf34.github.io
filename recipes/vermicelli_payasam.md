# Vermicelli Payasam 

First tasted this dish while living in Qatar with Omar and David. It's a sweet, milky dessert that is popular in India and the Middle East. 
Omar had been celebrating Eid with a local Indian family, who's mom insisted on sending him home with a large container of this dessert. 
I have been thinking about it ever since, and finally decided to try making it myself.

## Time 

30-ish minutes

## Ingredients 

- 100 grams of Vermicelli (rice noodles)
- 1 litre of whole milk 
- 100 grams of caster sugar 
- 6 cardamom pods 
- 30 grams of butter/ ghee 
- 30 grams of cashews 
- 30 grams of raisins
- a pinch of saffron (optional)


## Method

1. **Prepare the nuts and raisins:** Heat the butter in a pan and fry the cashews and raisins until the cashews are golden brown. Set aside.
1. **Prepare the Vermicelli:** If the vermicelli is long, break it into smaller pieces. Add more butter to the pan, and fry the vermicelli on 
a low heat until it is golden brown, stirring frequently. Be careful not to burn it. 
1. **Boil the milk:** In a separate pan, bring the milk to a boil. 
1. **Cook the vermicelli:** Add the boiled milk to the vermicelli, reduce to a low heat and let it simmer for 5 to 10 minutes. 
1. **Sweeten and flavour:** Add the sugar to the vermicelli and milk, and stir until it is dissolved. Crush the cardamom pods and add them 
to the mixture, along with the roasted nuts and raisins. Add the saffron if using.
1. **Serve:** Serve hot or cold :ok_hand:
