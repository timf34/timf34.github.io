# Hot Takes 

- Natural conception will become an amoral act within the next 100 years, once the cost and efficacy of IVF and genetic 
  screening (or similar technologies) are improved.

- More children's movies should have a "non-happy" ending. Not to be entirely bleak... but just not the typical, "and
  then they lived happily ever after" ending. Think something like Inside Out, or La La Land. 

- Crypto actually serves some very useful purposes. No its not going to solve all the worlds problems, but... sending remittances, circumventing corrupt banking systems, resisting authoritarian governments can only really be done with crypto. And its very good for sex workers too. 
  If nothing’s wrong with your country’s financial or political system, then you don’t need crypto. But if you’re in a country with a corrupt government, or a failing currency/ high inflation, or a lack of access to financial services, then crypto can be a lifeline.
