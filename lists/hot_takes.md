# Hot Takes 

- Natural conception will become an amoral act within the next 100 years, once the cost and efficacy of IVF and genetic 
  screening (or similar technologies) are improved.

- More children's movies should have a "non-happy" ending. Not to be entirely bleak... but just not the typical, "and
  then they lived happily ever after" ending. Think something like Inside Out, or La La Land.
