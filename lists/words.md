# We need more words for things

Language is more than just communication; it shapes our perception and observation. 
The right words help you see things more clearly, whether it's an emotion, sensation,
experience or the name of a local bird. Although English is pretty good, some
things are captured better in other tongues. Here's some:


- Feyli
  - _Dhivehi/ Maldives_
  - The feeling of sand between your toes as waves ebb away.
- Komorebi 
  - _Japanese_ 
  - The dappled sunlight that shines through tree leaves.
- Sobremesa
  - _Spanish_
  - The time spent sitting around the table and chatting freely long after 
  you've finished eating a meal. It's not about the meal, but the connection aftewards.
- Boketto
  - _Japanese_ 
  - Gazing vacantly into the distance without thinking.
- Shemomedjamo
  - _Georgian_ 
  - Eating past the point of being full just because the food tastes so good.
- Marek
  - _Serbian_ 
  - A feeling of blissful pleasure and contentment derived from enjoying simple, everyday moments.
- Hygge 
  - _Danish_
  - A profound _coziness_ and contentment drawn from simple pleasures, often in shared moments; such as enjoying a warm 
  drink with a friend by a fireplace.
- Wabi-sabi
  - _Japanese_
  - Embracing the beauty in imperfection and transience; valuing the inherent significance and stories of everyday 
  objects and moments.
- Marmeladenglasmomente
  - _German_
  - Moments and memories so dear to you, so full of joy and meaning, that you wish you could capture them 
  in a jar and keep them forever.
