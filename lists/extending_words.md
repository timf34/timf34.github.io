  - _Dhivehi/ Maldives_

  In particular, it means the visible light rays
- Sobremesa
  - _Spanish_
  - The time spent sitting around the table and chatting freely long after

- Boketto
  - _Japanese_ 
  - Gazing vacantly into the distance without thinking.
- Shemomedjamo
  - _Georgian_ 
  - Eating past the point of being full just because the food tastes so good.
