# We need more words for things

Language is more than just communication; it shapes our perception and observation. 
The right words help you see things more clearly, whether it's an emotion, sensation,
experience or the name of a local bird. Although English is pretty good, some
things are captured better in other tongues. Here's some:


- Feyli
  - _Dhivehi/ Maldives_
  - The feeling of sand between your toes as waves recede 
  on a beach
- Komorebi 
  - _Japanese_ 
  - Sunlight which is filtered through the leaves of the trees.
  In particular, it means the visible light rays
- Sobremesa
  - _Spanish_
  - The time spent sitting around the table and chatting freely long after 
  you've finished eating a meal.
- Boketto
  - _Japanese_ 
  - Gazing vacantly into the distance without thinking.
- Shemomedjamo
  - _Georgian_ 
  - Eating past the point of being full just because the food tastes so good.
