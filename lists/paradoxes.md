# Paradoxes 

Writing out some internal paradoxes I seem to have... 

- Scientific progress
  - I think scientific progress is like the best thing ever, but... The vulnerable hypothesis seems very valid to me. Not sure what to do about this. 
  - Women who seem very fake/ have had a lot of surgery, etc. is very unappealing and I find sad to think about... But I love and am warmed by the surgeon on insta I saw who did cosmetic surgery, but in a nice way lol (helping people with deformed faces)
    - Related to this... I'm very much in favour of longevity research in and such, but really don't like the idea of plastic surgery.
